# MICrONS-Dimensionality-Project
This project aims to characterize the representation dimensionality of the MICrONS dataset. The dataset includes both connectome and functional data of a 1 mm^3 subset of a mouse brain with 200,000 cells, 75,000 neurons with physiology, and 523 million synapses.
This repository will contain our Jupyter notebooks that we have created to analyze and visualize the MICrONS data. The neuron and synapse connectivity data is hosted on a server that we query using the through DataJoint Codebook in JupyterHub.
